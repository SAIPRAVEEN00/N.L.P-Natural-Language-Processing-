In such cases, the beneficiary of the term insurance policy receives only the total term life insurance premium amount paid by the insured from the insurance company (inclusive of extra premium, if any, but exclusive of applicable charges and taxes imposed by the government).Apart from the above, there are other exclusions as well, which come under critical illness rider. If any of these exclusions are found at the underwriting stage of the term insurance policy, then no benefit will be offered. Let’s take a look at the exclusions, which comes under critical illness rider. \\xa0Riders are the add-on coverage which can be purchased by the policyholder along with the basic term Plan in order to enhance the coverage of the policy. There are various online term insurance Plan which offer rider as an in-built feature of the policy. Before, zeroing in on an online term plan it is very important to check what are the in-built riders and add-on riders offered under term insurance policy. The rider benefit can be availed by paying an extra premium to the insurer along with the basic premium of the term policy. Some of the riders offered by the term Plan are:With this term insurance rider benefit, the insurance holder receives a lump-sum amount in case of valid diagnosis of any critical illnesses as pre-specified in the policy. The illnesses which are covered under critical illness cover are heart attack, cancer, paralysis, stroke, kidney failure, coronary artery bypass surgery, major organ transplant, etc.This is one of the most beneficial rider benefit offered under term insurance policy. Under this rider benefit, in case the life insured fails to pay the future premium of the term policy due to a disability or income loss, then all the future premiums of the term plan are waived off and the policy continues to remain active.Accidental death benefit rider can be bought in order to enhance the coverage of the term insurance policy. Under this rider benefit, an extra sum assured amount is paid to the beneficiary of the policy along with the basic sum assured amount in case of accidental demise of the insured person.\\xa0 This rider benefit works as a saviour by offering an add-on payment to the family at the time of financial hardship.This is an add-on rider benefit offered by the\\xa0term insurance\\xa0wherein, an extra sum assured amount is paid to the policyholder in case; he/she suffers from an accidental permanent or partial disability which leads to unemployment. Generally, the insurance companies offer 10% or more sum assured amount per year in order to compensate for the regular income that may happen due to total and permanent disability of the policyholder.This rider offered by term plan is specifically designed to generate income after the demise of the life insured. Under this rider benefit, the insured’s family receives additional income every year for the tenure of 5-10 years, along with the regular sum assured amount.There are various factors which determine how much term insurance\\xa0coverage one should take. For the convenience of the insurance buyers, here we have discussed some of the factors.The term offered by most of the term insurance Plan ranges between 5 to 40 years. One must opt for the term of a policy according to his/her retirement age. Indians generally retire at the age of 60 years. In this way, if a person purchases a term insurance plan at the age of 60 years, then by that age most of his/her liabilities and responsibilities are cleared. However, a policyholder can opt for the life cover till the age of 99 years, if he/she has several dependents and wants to provide financial coverage to them for their entire life span.The best thing about the online term plan is that the freedom of the policyholder to select the most suitable policy. In addition to this, the online term insurance plan as well bring some additional responsibility on the insured of staying focus and informed for the features of the product. It is only when one matches his/her requirements with the term plan; he/she is eligible to purchase it. Mentioned below are three steps for making the right choice while buying a term policy:The first step that every term life insurance buyer should consider while purchasing it to find out the amount of coverage as per the requirements of his/her family’s future needs. To find out the same, there are many term insurance calculators available online. One can use one of these calculators and find out how much he/she should invest per month so that the future requirements of his/her family are met when he/she is not around.If one wants to calculate it manually, then he/she can do the same by following the thumb rule of the term policy calculation. According to this rule, the life or term insurance coverage should be 15 times the annual salary of the policyholder. So, if Mr. A’s annual income is Rs.12 Lakh, then he requires a term insurance of Rs.1.8 Crore. However, the second step is also added in this, wherein one should also find out the required coverage from term life insurance for covering his/her other financial obligations like the higher education of policyholder’s children and other outstanding loans. For example, the sum of these financial obligations on Mr. A is Rs.50Lakh, and then the total coverage from the life or term insurance that he wants is Rs.2.3 Crore.Term insurance Plan are the purest form of life insurance. Term insurance premiums are lower than other life insurance Plan. However, in order to ensure the right plan, one should go for term insurance comparison.

For example, to provide coverage against critical illnesses or accidents, there are riders provided by most of the term insurance providers. One can check for an appropriate rider on an online term insurance provider’s website. The riders are available at an additional cost, but most of the insurers make these available at affordable premiums. Therefore, it is worth to attach a suitable rider in the term insurance plan. In this way, the policyholder will have better risk coverage and he/she can give better protection to his/her family.Purchasing an online term plan provides its policyholder with a lot of coverage. However, it is the responsibility of the insured to select the most affordable and suitable term insurance plan without missing out on any required detail. This is because a term plan secures the future of the family of the insured.Capitalize the world tenure of the term policy is an important aspect. This is because it involves the term insurance premium amount that one pays for his/her term insurance policy. The longer is this tenure, the greater will be the annual premium of the term plan. However, if one keeps this period very short, then there are chances of being without cover at the time when the family of the policyholder is at utmost need. Therefore, it is essential to consider different necessary factors such as the tenure of the term insurance plan and its coverage.Term insurance is the simplest form of life insurance product, which financially safeguards the future of the family and takes care of the liabilities in case of an eventuality.\\xa0Read MoreThe death benefit is the total sum assured amount paid to the beneficiary of the policy in case of the unfortunate demise of the insured person.\\xa0Read MoreTerm insurance riders are add-on benefits offered under the policy, in order to enhance the coverage of the policy.
